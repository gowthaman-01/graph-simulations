        body: `A shortest path (SSP) algorithm finds the most efficient route between two points (or nodes) in a graph, minimizing the sum of the weights of the edges it traverses. These algorithms are crucial in many real-world applications such as GPS navigation, network routing, and robotics.
        <br><br> This simulation contains the following SSP algorithms:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>BFS (Breadth-First Search):</b> Ideal for unweighted graphs</li>
            <li><b>Dijkstra:</b> Ideal for graphs with non-negative weights.</li>
            <li><b>Bellman-Ford:</b> Capable of handling negative weights and detecting negative cycles.</li>
            <li><b>A* Search:</b> Enhances Dijkstra's algorithm with heuristics to guide the search towards the target.</li>
            <li><b>DFS (Depth-First Search):</b> Explores each branch as far as possible before backtracking.</li>
            <li><b>Greedy Best-First Search:</b> Prioritizes nodes that appear to be closest to the goal, but DOES NOT guarantee the shortest path.</li>
        </ul>   
        Note: The A* Star search heuristics available in this simulation are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance" target="_blank">euclidean distance</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry" target="_blank">manhattan distance</a>.`,

        title: 'Grid Graphs',
        body: `Each node in the grid graph has a weight associated with it. Nodes with higher weights are indicated by darker backgrounds (refer to image below).
        <br><br>There are 2 types of grid graphs - <b>Standard</b> and <b>Maze</b>. Standard graphs are basic grid graphs with no walls. Maze graphs are generated using maze generation algorithms such as Recursive Division, Random Walls and DFS, and contain impassable walls.
        <br><br>Grid graphs can represent a variety of real-world scenarios, each with unique movement challenges. From road networks filled with traffic to smooth, flat terrains or hilly landscapes, these environments provide distinct obstacles. Let's explore how navigating these different terrains can be modeled using graph theory.`,

        title: 'Road Network [w = +ve]',
        body: `
    In this environment, you're driving a car through a network of roads, where each road segment (represented as a grid cell) has its own level of traffic congestion. Roads with heavier traffic, indicated by darker colours slow you down, while roads with less congestion allow for faster travel. The challenge is to navigate the road network efficiently, avoiding traffic jams and finding the quickest path to the destination.
    <br><br>In terms of graph theory, this environment is represented as a positively weighted graph, where road segments have positive values representing the level of congestion. Algorithms like Dijkstra's work well here to find the shortest path.
    <br><br>For example, suppose we have a road with a congestion value of 20. A car travelling through this road will require 20 units of effort (fuel) to travel through this road segment.`,

        body: `
    Imagine a golf ball rolling smoothly across a flat course. In this environment, every cell on the grid is equally easy for the ball to travel through, regardless of direction.
    <br><br>In terms of graph theory, this environment is represented as an <u>unweighted graph</u>, where all edges (paths) have equal cost or effort. The shortest path can be found using algorithms designed for unweighted graphs like BFS (Breadth-First Search).

            src: 'flat',

    {
        pageNumber: 6,
        title: 'Elevated Terrain [w = &#177;]',
        body: `
    In this environment, the golf ball must navigate a course with hills and slopes. Moving uphill requires more effort, and the effort is equal to the difference in elevation. On the other hand, moving downhill is easier due to gravity, and for simplicity, we simulate this by making the effort proportional to the square root of the elevation difference - an arbitrary choice to represent the ease of downhill movement.
    <br><br>In terms of graph theory, this environment is represented as a <u>graph with positive and negative edge weights</u>. While moving uphill has a positive cost, moving downhill can have a negative cost, representing the help of gravity.
    <br><br>For example, if point A is at elevation 10 and point B is at elevation 20, moving from A to B requires 10 units of effort (20 - 10). Moving from B to A requires less effort: the ball will move downhill with a cost of -âˆš(20 - 10).
    <br><br><u>Note:</u> Grid graph does not contain negative edge weight cycles, ensuring that paths are always valid and well-defined for all algorithms. Bellman-Ford is typically used to handle negative edge weights, while algorithms like Dijkstra's struggle with these cases.`,
