# Graph Simulations

Welcome to the Graph Simulations project! This project provides a simulation environment for graph traversal algorithms, focusing on grid-based graphs.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gowthaman-01/graph-simulations.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd graph-simulations
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run webpack to compile JavaScript modules from TypeScript:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can:

1. Click the "Run Simulation" button to start the algorithms.
2. Watch as the algorithms traverse the graph and highlight visited nodes and shortest paths.
